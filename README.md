# UnrealFirstProjectSourceFiles
Source Files for a course I took in Unreal Engine.

Since I made this I actually learned how to properly implement .gitignore, .gitattributes, and utilize LFS.

So, I no longer completely suck at git. Eventually, I am going to recreate this project with a proper .gitignore and .gitattributes on it with LFS properly setup and get this re-uploaded. So, I'll leave this here, but eventually I will be replacing it with a downloadable project that can actually be opened in Unreal.
